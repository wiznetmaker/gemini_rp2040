## üìù Project Overview

Recently, LLM language models have been popping up in various places, and we've created an example using Google's recently announced Gemini Pro. This project serves as a reference for using it with Pico, inspired by Wiznet Scarlet's OpenAI implementation. Currently, API calls to Gemini Pro are free. Seize this opportunity to build your own simple application.
